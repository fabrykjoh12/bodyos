# CLAUDE.md — BodyOS

Context for Claude Code (and humans) working on this repo. Read this first in a new session.

## Current status (2026-07-19) — read before picking work

- **THE REDESIGN SHIPPED** (branch `claude/bodyos-ui-ux-redesign-nh0994`, PR pending). The user
  superseded the option-sheet process with an "award-level redesign" mandate, and the full
  "precision instrument" redesign was implemented: deeper graphite palette, display type scale,
  physical gradient cards, floating pill nav, staggered motion + count-ups, cinematic Workout
  Complete. See "Design system" below — it describes the NEW system. Verify UI changes with
  `node scripts/shot.mjs <outdir>` (builds must exist in `dist/`; serves at /bodyos/ and
  screenshots key screens + the full gym flow at 390×844).
- **Cloud sync is LIVE on Firebase** (project `bodyos-e7372`): email/password (no confirmation
  step), Google one-tap, password reset. Config is committed in `src/lib/firebase.ts` (public by
  design). Sign-in is one tap from Home/Profile → `/account`.
- **Backlog** = `ROADMAP.md` Phase 6 (competitive positioning): program runner is the flagship gap;
  volume-landmarks v1 + rep-max estimates already shipped.
- Recent workflow: feature branch `claude/what-next-*` → PR → user merges (or asks to merge) →
  `git merge --ff-only origin/main`. Deploy is automatic on push to main. CI runs on push to main
  only — PRs get no checks, so local `typecheck && test && build` is the gate.

## What this is

**BodyOS** — a mobile-first workout tracker. The whole product is built around one promise:

> Track every set in seconds, and always know exactly what to beat next.

The **workout-tracking flow (Gym Mode)** is the most important part of the app. Dashboards,
analytics, and photos support it — they never crowd it. Design goal: a serious, premium
training tool, **not** a generic AI-looking dashboard.

- **Live:** https://fabrykjoh12.github.io/bodyos/ (GitHub Pages, private repo)
- **Repo:** https://github.com/fabrykjoh12/bodyos (owner `fabrykjoh12`, branch `main`)
- **Local dir:** `C:\Users\fabry\Documents\Koding\Projekt\BodyOs`

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # Vite dev server → http://localhost:5173  (base "/" in dev)
npm run test       # Vitest (121 tests: pure libs, store flows, component/integration)
npm run typecheck  # tsc -p tsconfig.json (strict, noUncheckedIndexedAccess)
npm run build      # tsc -b && vite build  (base "/bodyos/", emits dist/ + 404.html)
```

Deploy: **push to `main`** → GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) runs tests +
build and publishes to Pages. No manual step.

## Architecture / where things live

```
src/
  types/index.ts          Domain model. Templates (the plan) are SEPARATE from

### Routing (5-tab nav + profile in header avatar)
`/` Home · `/workouts` (+`/new`, `/routines`, `/:id`) · `/exercises` (+`/:id`) · `/stats` ·
`/progress` (+`/photos`, `/measurements`) · `/profile` · `/account` (sign-in) · `/settings` ·
`/session/:id` (Gym Mode) · `/session/:id/complete` · `/onboarding`. `/progress/strength` →
redirects to `/stats`. Screens are `React.lazy`-loaded in `App.tsx` (except Dashboard + GymMode).

## Design system ("precision instrument" — shipped 2026-07-19)

Tokens live in `tailwind.config.js`; component classes in `src/index.css`.

- **Volt `#CDFB45` is the ONLY accent** — primary action, PRs, active nav pill. Dark ink
  (`text-ink` = `#0A0C05`) on volt fills (never `text-white` on volt).
- **Ice `#5FA8FF` (`text-ice`) means "reference / last-time data" ONLY** — never decorative.
- Graphite surface stack: `base #0B0D11` < `surface #171B21` < `surface-2` < `surface-3`;
  hairline borders are white-alpha (`border-line`). The body has a faint volt aurora at the top.
- **Cards are "physical"**: `.card` = gradient light-from-above + inset top highlight + soft
  ambient shadow; `.card-hero` (bigger radius, volt-tinged radial) is the one big moment per
  screen; `.inset-panel` for quiet panels inside cards; `.row-list` for un-boxed divider lists.
- **Typography carries hierarchy**: display scale `text-display-xl/display/title/heading/stat`
  (Archivo, tight tracking, ~750 weight). **Every numeral uses `.tnum`** (Geist Mono).
  Eyebrow labels: `.label-tiny` (10.5px, semibold, 0.14em tracking).
- **Motion is choreography, not decoration**: `.stagger` (children rise in sequence),
  `CountUp` (ui component — animated stat numerals), `animate-rise/pop-in/ping-once`,
  `.shimmer-once` + `shadow-accent-glow` reserved for PR/celebration moments,
  spring easings (`ease-spring`). All gated by prefers-reduced-motion.
- **Layout**: screen gutter is `--gutter` (1.25rem) — use `px-[var(--gutter)]` for frames and
  `.bleed` for full-bleed rows. Sections breathe: `gap-6`+ between sections, `p-6` hero/stat cards.
- **Nav**: floating frosted pill (`BottomNav`) — active tab expands into a volt capsule.
- **One volt primary action per screen.** 48px min touch targets, 56px primary buttons (`size="xl"`),
  mono numbers dominate the active-set screen.

## Data & state

- `AppData` (persisted root) = user, templates, sessions (history), activeSession, PRs,
  photos, measurements, weeklyPlan, streakDates, restTimer.
- **Active session + rest timer survive refresh** (persisted). Undo is available after logging.
- Store persists the whole `AppData` slice to `localStorage` after every mutation, through the
  `Repository` abstraction — so a networked `Repository` can replace it with zero UI changes.
- **Optional cloud sync** (`store/cloudSync.ts`, **Firebase**): when signed in (Firebase
  email/password — no email-confirmation step — set up in Account → Sign in), `persist()` also
  mirrors the blob to Firestore doc `bodyos_app_state/{uid}` — debounced push on write, pull +
  last-write-wins reconcile on sign-in (reconcile clock = Firestore `serverTimestamp`). localStorage
  remains the synchronous source of truth; sync is a background layer, so the sync `Repository`
  interface is untouched. `photos` + `restTimer` are **not** synced (privacy + ephemeral). The
  Firebase web config is committed (public by design; **Firestore security rules** enforce
  owner-only access — see below). Paste the config into `src/lib/firebase.ts` to enable; empty
  config ⇒ sync section hides (`status: 'unconfigured'`), app stays fully offline.
  - **Firestore rules** (set in the Firebase console → Firestore → Rules):
    ```
    rules_version = '2';
    service cloud.firestore {
      match /databases/{database}/documents {
        match /bodyos_app_state/{userId} {
          allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  - We migrated off Supabase (ran out of free project slots; Supabase's default email delivery
    blocked sign-up). Firebase email/password signs users in immediately, so no email is needed.

## Gotchas (things that have bitten us — don't repeat)

1. **GitHub Pages base path.** Vite `base` is `/bodyos/` in build (`vite.config.ts`), and
   `BrowserRouter` uses `basename={import.meta.env.BASE_URL}` (main.tsx). A `404.html` copy of
   index.html gives SPA deep-link fallback. Pages **Build source must be "GitHub Actions"**
   (not "deploy from a branch" — that serves raw source → blank page).
2. **Zustand selectors must NOT return freshly-derived arrays** (`.filter`/`.map` inline) —
   it triggers React's getSnapshot loop and crashes the screen. Select the raw slice and derive
   with `useMemo` (bit us in WorkoutComplete/Workouts).
3. **`tsc -b` type-checks `vite.config.ts`** via `tsconfig.node.json`, so `@types/node` must be
   installed. `vite build` alone doesn't catch this; `npm run build` (CI) does.
4. Build artifacts `vite.config.js/.d.ts` + `*.tsbuildinfo` are git-ignored — don't commit them.
5. Private repo + GitHub Pages needs GitHub Pro (site is currently serving, so it's fine).

## Environment notes

- **Cloud (Claude Code on the web) sessions:** `gh` is unavailable — use the GitHub MCP tools for
  PRs/merges; plain `git push` works. Set `git config user.email noreply@anthropic.com` +
  `user.name Claude` before committing (a stop-hook checks committer email). Outbound network is
  blocked (Firebase/Supabase/CDNs unreachable) — verify UI with local Playwright: build, serve
  `dist/` at `/bodyos/` with a tiny node http server, launch
  `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-*/chrome-linux/chrome` via the global playwright at
  `/opt/node22/lib/node_modules/playwright`, screenshot at 390×844. Run scripts from the repo dir.
- **Local (user's Windows machine):** git push works via cached Git Credential Manager; an ECC
  "GateGuard" hook prompts for "facts" before the first Bash command / new-file writes — present
  the facts and retry.
- End commit messages with `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`.

## Exercise visuals

The library uses **crafted glyph tiles** by default: `components/exercise/ExerciseGlyph.tsx`
(minimal per-equipment line glyphs) inside `ExerciseThumb.tsx` (muscle-tinted dark gradient tile).
Consistent across all 66 exercises, no image files required. The earlier generated 3D-mannequin
photos were blobby/inconsistent and were removed.

**Optional curated photos** can be layered back in — `ExerciseThumb` prefers a photo for any id in
its `PHOTO_IDS` set (empty by default). See `docs/exercise-photos.md` to regenerate a better set
locally (the cloud sandbox blocks the Higgsfield CDN, so the download step must run on your machine).

### Legacy photo pipeline (Higgsfield)

Exercise images are neutral 3D-figure illustrations generated via the **Higgsfield MCP**
(`generate_image`, model `nano_banana_pro`, ~2 credits each). Style prompt template:

> "Minimalist 3D illustration of a single neutral grey mannequin-style figure performing
> {EXERCISE}, clean matte studio render, dark charcoal background #0E1013, subtle lime-green
> #CDFB45 rim lighting, centered composition, no text, no logos, premium fitness app icon style"

Pipeline: generate → `show_generations` for the `minUrl` (webp) → `curl` into
`public/exercises/<exercise-id>.webp`. `ExerciseThumb` references `${BASE_URL}exercises/<id>.webp`
and falls back to a muscle-tinted tile on 404. **15 of 55 exercises have photos**; the rest use
the fallback. See `ROADMAP.md` for the remaining list.

## Testing

121 tests. Pure libs (progression, volume, plates, format, plan, prstats/liveSetPr, analytics,
volumeLandmarks, repMax), store flows (gymFlow: supersets, deloads, warm-ups, RIR, routines,
addExerciseToSession; repository incl. parseBackup; cloudSync reconciliation), and Testing-Library
component/integration suites (ActiveSetCard, SetGrid, Profile, GymMode on its real route). Match
these styles when adding tests. Run `npm run test`.

## How to verify a change (before claiming done)

`npm run typecheck && npm run test && npm run build`, then drive the real flow in a browser.
In cloud sessions use the Playwright pattern from "Environment notes" (serve `dist/`, screenshot
at 390×844 — this caught real bugs like the clipped Gym stepper). On the user's machine,
`npm run dev` + the in-app browser (screenshots may time out; prefer DOM checks).
