## ✅ Phase 0 — MVP (shipped)

- ✅ App scaffold: React + TS (strict) + Vite + Tailwind + Zustand + Router + Recharts + Vitest
- ✅ Domain model (templates ≠ sessions), exercise library, seeded demo data
- ✅ Progressive-overload engine (double progression, reduce/deload on stalls, reasons) + tests
- ✅ Store + `Repository` persistence abstraction over localStorage; active-session & rest-timer recovery
- ✅ Gym Mode: one-tap Log Set, smart prefill, auto weight copy-forward, auto rest timer, undo,
  difficulty rating, exercise history
- ✅ Dashboard, Workouts (+ planning/editor), Exercises, Progress, Photos, Profile, Settings, Onboarding
- ✅ Workout completion summary with progression recommendations + PR detection
- ✅ Progress photos (private, local, pose guide, before/after slider)
- ✅ 27 tests (progression, volume/1RM, unit conversion, full store flow)
- ✅ Deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions (base `/bodyos/`, SPA 404 fallback)

## ✅ Phase 1 — UI overhaul (shipped)

Ported the user's mockup design system so it reads as a real product, not an AI template.

- ✅ Design tokens → Tailwind: volt `#CDFB45` sole accent, near-black surfaces, ice `#5FA8FF`
  for reference data, hairline borders
- ✅ Self-hosted fonts: Archivo (UI) + Geist Mono (all numerals via `.tnum`)
- ✅ Eyebrow labels, volt primary buttons (dark ink), one primary action per screen
- ✅ 5-tab nav (Home · Workouts · Exercises · Stats · Progress); Profile → header avatar
- ✅ New **Stats** screen (strength trends + all PRs); `/progress/strength` redirects to it
- ✅ Dashboard rebuilt to mockup anatomy: hero, KPI grid, weekly-volume bars, 1RM sparkline,
  muscle-balance bars, PR list, recent sessions
- ✅ Contrast fixes (no white-on-volt); ice-blue "last time" values in Gym Mode

## ✅ Phase 2 — Real-app feel

- ✅ Code-splitting: lazy routes → initial bundle **662 kB → ~250 kB**; Recharts isolated in a
  lazy chunk
- ✅ PWA manifest + volt app icon → installable, standalone display, theme color
- ✅ **Offline service worker** (`vite-plugin-pwa` / Workbox, `generateSW` + `autoUpdate`) —
  precaches the app shell, all hashed chunks, fonts, and exercise photos (49 entries, ~1 MB);
  `navigateFallback` → `/bodyos/index.html` so SPA deep links resolve offline. SW disabled in
  dev (`devOptions.enabled: false`); the hand-authored `public/manifest.webmanifest` is kept
  (`manifest: false`).

## ✅ Exercises & visuals

- ✅ Library expanded to **66 exercises** across all muscle groups (instructions, coaching cues,
  equipment, patterns, substitutions)
- ✅ **Crafted glyph tiles** (`ExerciseGlyph` + `ExerciseThumb`): muscle-tinted gradient tiles with
  per-equipment line glyphs, consistent across the whole library — replaced the blobby AI photos.
- ✅ **Muscle map** (`MuscleMap`): front/back body highlighting muscles by intensity. On the
  exercise detail it shows what a movement trains (primary bright, secondary faint); on the
  Dashboard the same component is a **weekly training heatmap** (shaded by sets per muscle) so you
  can see what you're neglecting when planning. Pure SVG.
- ✅ Library search + muscle/equipment filters + live result count; detail screen has 1RM chart,
  last-performed, how-to, **form cues**, and substitutions.
- ⬜ **Optional curated photos** — can be layered back in via `ExerciseThumb`'s `PHOTO_IDS` set;
  regenerate a better set locally per `docs/exercise-photos.md` (cloud sandbox blocks the CDN).

## 🟡 Phase 3 — Polish

- ✅ Screen transitions (subtle per-route `page-in` enter) + tap-scale press feedback on cards
- ✅ Refined empty states (inviting accent-tinted icon, fade-in) + onboarding steps animate in
- ✅ Onboarding audit: captures the user's **name** (final step) so the home greeting is personal
  instead of the seeded "Athlete"; fixed the days-per-week grid (5 options no longer wrap 4+1); and
  added `aria-pressed` to every choice control (goal, experience, days, routine, equipment, units)
  so they announce as toggles.
- ✅ Training-consistency calendar on Progress (`ConsistencyGrid`): contribution-style grid of
  workout days over the last 16 weeks, cells shaded by set count
- ✅ **Rest-timer completion alert** — a two-tone Web Audio chime (`lib/sound.ts`, no assets) plays
  when the rest timer finishes, alongside the vibration. Both are opt-out: the buzz honours the
  existing "Haptic feedback" toggle, the chime a new "Rest timer sound" toggle (Settings). Audio is
  primed from the "Log Set" tap (`unlockAudio`) so mobile browsers allow it.
- ✅ **Data export / import** — Settings → Data → "Export data" downloads the full `AppData` as a
  timestamped JSON backup (`bodyos-backup-YYYY-MM-DD.json`); "Import data" restores from one via a
  file picker. Import is validated + normalized by a pure, tested `parseBackup` (rejects non-BodyOS
  JSON so a stray file can't wipe your log) and gated behind a confirm sheet that shows the backup's
  template/session counts before it overwrites. `exportData` store action + `replaceAll` for apply.
- ✅ **Per-set "beat this" target + beat marker** — the active-set card shows last time's performance
  on the *same working set* (e.g. "Beat last time · 105 kg × 7") in ice under the objective, making
  the product promise ("always know exactly what to beat next") concrete set-by-set. Once a set is
  logged that beats it (heavier, or same load for more reps), the set ledger flags it with a volt
  "Beat" chip — closing the loop with a small celebration in the reserved accent colour. Both are
  suppressed on warm-ups and deloads (where going lighter is the point).
- ✅ **In-session PR celebration** — logging a set that sets a new **all-time** best (heaviest set or
  best est. 1RM for that exercise) fires an immediate volt-glow moment (`PrCelebration`, the reserved
  `shadow-accent-glow`) with a trophy, the lift, and which record fell — auto-dismissing after 3 s.
  Detection (`liveSetPr`, tested) compares the just-logged set against prior PRs *and* the exercise's
  earlier session sets, so only genuine new tops celebrate; it's ephemeral (completion's
  `detectPersonalRecords` stays the recorded-PR source of truth) and skipped on deloads.
- ✅ **Rest timer −15s** — the running rest timer now has a "−15s" control next to "+15s" and Skip,
  so you can shorten a rest you don't need (clamps at 0; reuses `addRestTime`).
- ✅ **Edit / remove a logged set** — tap any completed set in the Gym Mode ledger to open a sheet
  and fix its weight/reps or remove it (wires the existing `editSet`/`removeSet` store actions). Fixes
  the gap where only the *last* set could be undone; earlier mis-logs were previously stuck.
- ✅ **Add an exercise mid-workout** — a "+ Add" chip in the Gym Mode exercise strip opens a searchable
  library picker; the chosen movement is appended to the active session (prefilled from its history via
  `prefillFor`) and jumped to. New `addExerciseToSession` action (tested), for accessories you decide
  to do on the fly.
- 🟡 Haptics coverage (Gym Mode logs honour the toggle); safe-area audit on a real device still todo
- ✅ Component/integration tests for Gym Mode: `ActiveSetCard.test.tsx`, `SetGrid.test.tsx`, and a
  `GymMode.test.tsx` integration suite that renders the screen on its route and drives the wired-up
  flow — active set → log → advance, the "no longer active" fallback, the **beat marker + PR
  celebration** lighting up on a record set, and the **superset banner** when parked on a superset
  exercise. Store flow stays covered by `gymFlow.test.ts`. **98 tests** total.

## 🟡 Phase 4 — Accounts & cloud sync (Firebase)

Optional email/password accounts + whole-blob cloud sync. **Migrated from Supabase → Firebase**
(ran out of free Supabase project slots; Supabase's default email delivery blocked sign-up).

- ✅ **Auth** — Firebase email/password, fully optional (offline-first; no forced login). Crucially
  **no email-confirmation step** — sign-up signs you in immediately, which fixes the "confirmation
  email never arrives" problem. `src/store/cloudSync.ts`, `src/lib/firebase.ts`.
- ✅ **Cloud sync** — the whole `AppData` is mirrored to Firestore doc `bodyos_app_state/{uid}`.
  Pushed on save (debounced 1.5 s), pulled + reconciled on sign-in. Conflicts: whole-blob
  **last-write-wins** by Firestore `serverTimestamp`. localStorage stays the synchronous source of
  truth; cloud is a background layer — the synchronous `Repository` interface is untouched.
  Reconciliation core is unit-tested (`cloudSync.test.ts`); the Firebase SDK is lazy-loaded (its own
  chunk) to keep it out of the initial bundle.
- ✅ **Discoverable sign-in** — the Profile account card + a dedicated `/account` screen put the
  sign-in form one tap from Profile (shared `CloudSync` component; Settings hosts it too). Friendly
  auth-error messages, password show/hide. (`Profile.test.tsx` covers the three states.) Also a
  **Home sign-in banner** when signed out, so login doesn't depend on the header avatar — which the
  iOS status bar could cover in the installed PWA. Fixed that too: the app frame now applies
  `safe-top`, so headers/avatars clear the notch on iPhone.
- ✅ **Password reset** — a "Forgot password?" link on the sign-in form sends a Firebase reset email
  (`resetPassword` → `sendPasswordResetEmail`); Firebase delivers these reliably. Positive feedback
  shown in a neutral notice, errors in red.
- 🔧 **Enable it** — paste the Firebase web config into `src/lib/firebase.ts` and set the Firestore
  owner-only rules (both documented in `CLAUDE.md`). Empty config ⇒ the sync UI hides; app stays
  fully offline.
- ⬜ **Progress-photo sync** — photos are device-local by design; would need Firebase Storage + an
  upload flow.
- ✅ **Google sign-in** — one-tap "Continue with Google" at the top of the auth form
  (`signInWithGoogle`): popup with an automatic full-page **redirect fallback** for installed PWAs
  where popups are blocked; `getRedirectResult` completes the redirect flow on load. Inline Google
  'G' mark (no asset). **Console step to enable:** turn on the Google provider in Firebase Auth and
  add `fabrykjoh12.github.io` to Auth → Settings → Authorized domains.

## 🟡 Phase 5 — Deeper training features

- ✅ **Plate calculator** — per-side barbell breakdown shown live under the weight in Gym Mode
  (barbell lifts only), unit-aware (kg/lb bar + plate sets), reports any unloadable remainder.
  Pure logic in `lib/plates.ts` (`computePlates`), 7 tests.
- ✅ **Warm-up set generator** — one tap inserts a ramping warm-up (empty bar → ~50/70/85 %) before
  the working sets on a barbell exercise (`generateWarmups` + `addWarmupSets` store action), 4 tests.
- ✅ **Swap exercise mid-workout** — in Gym Mode, tap the swap icon on an unstarted exercise to
  replace it with a substitution (or a same-muscle alternative); sets are re-prefilled from the new
  exercise's history via `prefillFor` (`swapExercise` action). Hidden once a set is logged.
- ✅ **Per-exercise notes** — a durable note-to-self on each exercise, editable on the detail
  screen and shown on the active-set card in Gym Mode (`exerciseNotes` in AppData, syncs).
- ✅ **Supersets** — mark consecutive exercises as a superset in the editor ("Superset with
  above"); Gym Mode then alternates set-by-set between them, resting only after each round.
  Opt-in — ungrouped exercises behave exactly as before. (`supersetGroup` on the template +
  session; the alternating logic lives in `logActiveSet`.)
- ✅ **Optional RPE/RIR entry** — when "Show RIR / RPE" is on (Settings), each working set gets a
  0–4+ reps-in-reserve picker in Gym Mode (with RPE equivalent); RIR is shown in the set ledger and
  **feeds progression** by mapping to per-set difficulty (`rirToDifficulty`, in the tested engine).
- ✅ **Body-measurement tracking UI** — `/progress/measurements`: log body weight + waist/chest/arm,
  latest-snapshot tiles with deltas, dated history with delete, unit-aware (kg/cm or lb/in). Seeded
  with a demo lean-bulk trend; `deleteMeasurement` action added.
- 🟡 Week planning / deload scheduling
  - ✅ **Starter routines** (`/workouts/routines`): pick a split (Full Body 3×, Upper/Lower 4×,
    PPL 6×) and it builds the workout templates and drops them onto the weekly plan in one tap.
    Also offered during onboarding (days-matched split pre-selected as "Recommended").
  - ✅ **Week planning** — the Workouts weekly strip is now editable: tap any day to assign a
    template or set a rest day (wires up the existing `setPlanForDay` + `weeklyPlan`).
  - ✅ **Honest home hero** — the Dashboard hero no longer mislabels everything "Today's session".
    A pure `resolveTodayPlan` reads the weekly plan and the hero adapts: *Today's session* when one
    is planned, a calm **Rest day** card (with a "Train anyway · {next}" option) on scheduled rest
    days, *Next up · {Tomorrow/weekday}* when today is unplanned, or *Suggested* with no plan at all.
    Tested (`plan.test.ts`, 9 cases). The **Workouts** weekly strip shows a matching "Today · …"
    summary line (same resolver), so both screens describe the schedule identically.
  - ✅ **Deload** — start any workout as a deload (Dashboard hero / workout detail): ~90% load,
    sets capped at 2, badged in Gym Mode + history. Deloads are excluded from progression
    baselines (prefill, stall counting, PRs) so they don't corrupt your numbers.

## Suggested next session

1. **Enable Firebase sync** — create a Firebase project, enable Email/Password auth, paste the web
   config into `src/lib/firebase.ts`, and set the Firestore owner-only rules (see `CLAUDE.md`).
2. Finish exercise photos (remaining ~40) — quick, high visual impact.
3. Google (OAuth) sign-in — easy on Firebase once the base auth is live.

See `CLAUDE.md` for architecture, conventions, the design system, and gotchas.
